Currently Bazel Steward supports:
* Bazel version - defined in .bazelversion or .bazeliskrc file.
* Maven dependencies added through the rules_jvm_external
* Some of Bazel rules

We plan to extend the support to update all bazel rules, bazel modules, http_archives and languages like Go, Python or JavaScript.

We are also planning to support more git hosting methods, but for now, we only support GitHub.
