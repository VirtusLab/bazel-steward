You can use Bazel Steward through our GitHub Action, run it from Maven Central, or use a JAR from Github Releases.

{: .note }
Bazel Steward will run basic Bazel queries, so any non standard environment that is required for your project to bootstrap in Bazel needs to be ready before running Bazel Steward.
