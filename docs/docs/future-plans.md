# Future Plans

Currently Bazel Steward supports:
* Bazel version - defined in .bazelversion or .bazeliskrc file.
* Maven dependencies added through the rules_jvm_external
* Bazel rules (and bazel modules)

We plan to extend the support to update http_archives and languages like Go, Python or JavaScript and more.

We are also planning to support more git hosting methods, but for now, we only support GitHub.

**Let us know what are the features that you need to adapt Bazel Steward in your project!**
